# SpaceColonizationTreeGenerator

A procedural tree generator for Unity using Space Colonization Algorithm

## Sapce Colonization

Space Colonization is an algorithm for creating procedural tree models described by Adam Runions, Brendan Lane, and Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz in "Modeling Trees with a Space Colonization Algorithm" (http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/colonization.egwnp2007.pdf).
